  // The intention here is to:
  // - Not create too many updates at the same time: when multiple updates are
  //   proposed at the same time, a single auto-merge forcefully rebases all the
  //   other updates and retriggers all the GHA builds, making it kind of
  //   expensive in term of GHA costs.
  // - Propose updates early: by not having too many updates at the same time,
  //   they are being dispatched over a longer period of time.

  // Consider any days to open PRs
  "schedule": ["at any time"],

  // Try not to overwork GitHub Actions too much with concurrent PRs.
